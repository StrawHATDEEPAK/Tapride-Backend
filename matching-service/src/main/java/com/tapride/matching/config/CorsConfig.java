/**
 * Allows the frontend (running on a different origin than this API - a
 * different port under docker-compose, a different host under the k8s
 * Ingress, or a different onrender.com domain entirely once deployed) to
 * call this API. Without this, every fetch() call from the browser fails
 * with a generic "Failed to fetch" error, even though the request never
 * reaches this service at all - the browser blocks it before sending, per
 * CORS rules.
 *
 * Allowed origins are read from an environment variable rather than
 * hardcoded - Render assigns each service's public URL at creation time
 * (something like https://tapride-frontend-xyz1.onrender.com), which isn't
 * known until after first deploy. Hardcoding a guessed URL here would mean
 * rebuilding the image every time it turned out wrong; reading it from
 * config means it's just a dashboard env var to fix, no rebuild needed.
 *
 * Defaults cover local dev (docker-compose) and the k8s Ingress host, so
 * nothing breaks for either of those if the env var isn't set.
